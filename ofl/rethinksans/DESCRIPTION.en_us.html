<p>Rethink Sans was created in 2023 by Rethinkâ€™s ECD of Design Hans Thiessen. Deceptively simple, Rethink Sans is filled with thoughtfully turbocharged features, including: weight-specific tracking, two styles of circled numbers a simple keystroke away, and tabular lining figures right out-of-the-box.</p>
