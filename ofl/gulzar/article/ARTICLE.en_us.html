<p><a href="http://corvelsoftware.co.uk/">Simon Cozens</a>, <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/typography/staff/dr-borna-izadpanah">Dr. Borna Izadpanah</a>, and <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/typography/staff/professor-fiona-ross">Dr. Fiona Ross</a> conducted their own research and consulted with Urdu language specialists in Pakistan and the United Kingdom to create the Gulzar Urdu Nasta'liq typeface project. Gulzar means "flower meadow" in Urdu.</p>
<p>Izadpanah is a native Persian speaker from Tehran, Iran. He learned Nasta'liq as a model for Persian handwriting in primary school.</p>
<p>"Designing a digital Nasta'liq typeface was my long-held dream," Izadpanah stated. As the principal Gulzar designer, he conducted the preliminary research and drew the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/glyph">glyphs</a>.</p>
<p>Ross was familiar with the Urdu language and type design from her language studies and earlier work on two Nasta'liq typefaces, Sheeraz and Qalmi, for which <a href="https://github.com/simoncozens/nastaliq-engineering/blob/master/GB2208556A.pdf">Linotype acquired a patent</a>.</p>
<p>To make a modern digital font based on the Urdu flavor of the Nasta'liq style, Izadpanah studied the proportions, stroke modulation, and character features in <a href="https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/calligraphy">calligraphy</a> manuals and a collection of <a href="https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/lettering">lettering</a> specimens</p>
